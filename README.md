# Tennis_game_assignment
A simple GUI-based tennis scoring system built using Python and Tkinter. </br>

Tennis has a rather quirky scoring system, and to newcomers it can be a little difficult to keep track of. Your
task is to build a Python program that displays the current score during a tennis game. The program should
accept input from an external input source (user input, file, etc.) and then display the current tennis score.
The program should keep accepting new scores until the user terminates the program.

# Conditions 
1) A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more
than the opponent.
2) The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to
three points are described as Love, Fifteen, Thirty, and Forty respectively.
3) If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is Deuce.
4) If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his
opponent, the score of the game is Advantage for the player in the lead.
